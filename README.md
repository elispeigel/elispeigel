- ⚙️ I'm currently working on a linux container runtime package using go called spocker and a smart home management package and api called base.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Rust with [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.  
- 📚 I just finished reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann, and "grokking algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava is next.
