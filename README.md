### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Rust with [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.
- 📚 I just finished reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann, and "grokking algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava is next.
- ⚙️ I'm currently working on a school district-based house search service using [Actix](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) and [PostGIS](https://github.com/postgis/postgis).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting. I love a good challenge or making an impact.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
